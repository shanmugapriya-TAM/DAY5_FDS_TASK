//Difference between window screen and objects in javascript
window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.
window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.
Since window is the global object, you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window. - it will be figured out by the runtime.
Comparision between document and window ,screen
Document Objects:
    Represents a web page loaded in the browser.
    Accessed using window.document or simply document.
    Allows access to elements within the HTML page.
    Used for adding dynamic content to the web page.
    Common properties include:
        activeElement: Returns the currently active element.
        body: Returns the contents of the <body> element.
        title: Returns the title of the document.
    Common methods include:
        addEventListener(): Attaches an event handler.
        adoptNode(): Adopts a node from another document.

Window Objects:
    Represents the browser window or frame.
    Contains properties, methods, and functionalities related to the entire window.
    Global object accessible as window.
    The document object is a property of the window.
    Provides broader scope beyond the specific web page.
    Example properties:
        screen: Information about physical screen dimensions.
        location: URL of the current page.

Screen:
    The window.screen object contains information about the user's screen.
    The window.screen object can be written without the window prefix.
        Properties:
            screen.width---This property returns the width of the visitor's screen in pixels.
            screen.height---This property returns the height of the visitor's screen in pixels.
            screen.availWidth---This property returns the width of the visitor's screen, in pixels, minus interface features like the Windows Taskbar.
            screen.availHeight---This property returns the height of the visitor's screen, in pixels, minus interface features like the Windows Taskbar.
            screen.colorDepth---This property returns the number of bits used to display one color.
            screen.pixelDepth---This property returns the pixel depth of the screen.
        In modern computers, Color Depth and Pixel Depth are equal.
        screen properties width and height are the full screen
        screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar
In summary, while the document object focuses on representing and manipulating content within an HTML document, the window object encompasses the entire browser window and its properties.
window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
